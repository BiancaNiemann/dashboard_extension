# Scrimba Dashboard Extension Project

## About

In this project for the Scrimba Front-end developer Career Path we learnt how to create our own Dashboard extension for Google Chrome, it is based on the Momentum Dashboard.

We added features using APIS like current time and date, openweather API, motivational quotes and background images from unsplash

As an stretch goal I also added a ToDo list that saves the info to localStorage

## What I Learnt doing this project

- APIs and how to fetch them: open weather, Unsplash, and Coin Gecko(although I did not use this in my final code)
- Chrome Extension
- Javascript
- Flexbox

Happy Coding!
